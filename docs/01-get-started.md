# Get started with Blazor

Blazor is fast and easy to get started with. We've already done all the work you'll need to get started on these machines. But to set up a machine with Blazor yourself, here's what you need to do:

1. Go to https://blazor.net
1. Click on the "Get Started" link

1. Follow the instructions for the platform of your choice - Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Blazor requires the .NET Core 3.0 (or newer) SDK. Visual Studio on Windows will install this for you. On macOS or Linux, you can use Visual Studio Code with the C# extension.
